<p>Social media marketing has exploded in the past five years, and it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Of the available channels for social media outreach, Facebook remains the 800-lb. silverback gorilla of them all. Business2Community estimates 70 percent of marketers currently use Facebook as one of their chief methods to adding new customers and generating leads. Moreover, 47 percent of marketers stated  Facebook is the number one source of new business. Clearly, marketing on Facebook gets results. How does it work? Let’s get an overview of how businesses are reaching more new customers on Facebook.</p>



<h3>Facebook Marketing: What It Is And How It Works</h3>



<p>Using Facebook to market your business means posting authentic, original content via a business account or individual account. This content is purpose-built for viral sharing among regular Facebook users, and it always points them back to your website, landing page or Facebook profile. </p>



<p>When you market on Facebook, you are putting your business out there as a thought leader and content creator who is looking to help other Facebook users meet their needs and desires through your products and/or services. There are two principal methods to go about this process, and you can decide for yourself how much or how little actual marketing dollars you want to invest. </p>



<h3>Organic Facebook Advertising</h3>



<p>Considered the most effective and powerful form of Facebook marketing, this method focuses on fostering the “organic reach” of your content. Organic reach refers to how many users have viewed your posts and content through unpaid distribution. In other words, people who have seen what you put out on Facebook without you paying to sponsor its placement in newsfeeds. </p>



<p>Since it’s unpaid, it is going to have a lower cost-per-add of new customers who discover your business via sharing. The downside is the organic method requires far more work intensive for your marketing team, and you will need to tailor content to the demographics of users who have expressed interest and your product/services target demographic. Additionally, unless your content compels users to click, read more and engage with landing pages or other lead collection methods, you aren’t going to see the same results as you would from paid content promotion via Facebook Ads dashboard. </p>



<h3>Paid Facebook Advertising</h3>



<p>The sheer volume of content created for organic marketing on Facebook is staggering, and it has actually started to decrease its own effectiveness to a degree. If you are looking to build some momentum to help your content get found by the right people, you may need to consider setting up paid advertising for some posts. Facebook implements by adding a Boost button to posts on your newsfeed, and if you want to boost a post to reach your target audience you just need to complete a few simple forms.</p>



<p>First, you pick the audience type that coincides with your ideal customer demographic. Next, you pick a budget of how much you want to spend. You can prepay a certain amount and then the post no longer gets promoted after your budget has been exhausted. This is a great way to keep your advertising spending under control so you don’t end up with a hefty surprise item that pushes your marketing team over budget. Finally, you select how long you want to boost your content post. Choosing how long to promote content is another cost control measure, and it also helps Facebook provide an estimate for recommending a budget. </p>



<p>Paid Facebook advertising has the drawback of an additional cost to promote your presence on Facebook, but it is also a guaranteed method for ensuring your content regarding products/services is seen and read by your target audience. New customer ads from paid advertising might not be as profitable as organic marketing, but it keeps revenue coming all the same.</p>



<h3>A Winning Combination: Using Organic And Paid Marketing Together To Drive Sales</h3>



<p>Smart marketers and marketing agencies use the ad performance data from their organic marketing outreach to better target their paid outreach. When you evaluate who looks at your content the most when it is not sponsored, it tells you who is looking for your specific products/services, when they look, their demographic information and other information to help you pinpoint everything in your content and promote it to the best audience. Most marketing agencies are willing to spend the money to promote their content at first and then let organic content take over or balance out how much or how little they spend on the actual sponsored content.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social media has become an integral part of our lives, and no platform is more ubiquitous than Facebook. Every year, it seems that the company expands its outreach to encompass more people and offer more services, which makes it an ideal marketing tool for businesses. </p>



<p>Today, we want to discuss the value of Facebook marketing and how it can help you achieve your goals. Regardless of the kind of company you have, marketing on Facebook is going to boost your brand awareness and ensure long-term success. Let’s discover how you can make that a reality. </p>



<h2>Organic vs. Paid Advertising</h2>



<p>One of the reasons why social media has taken off in recent years is that it put small businesses on the same footing as large corporations. Setting up a page was free, and with the right amount of effort and creativity, you could generate a large following. </p>



<p>While that’s still possible today, it’s much more challenging. The fact is that companies like Facebook are pushing hard to monetize their marketing services. With so much user information available, you can reach target demographics with pinpoint precision. </p>



<p>Thus, paid advertising is going to help you get a lot more traction. Building an organic audience of followers is still advisable, but it will take much longer to get the same results. Being active on social media is a must regardless of which route you choose but paying Facebook for a broader reach is going to provide a significantly better ROI. </p>



<h2>Types of Facebook Marketing</h2>



<p>Before we get into the benefits of using this platform, let’s go over the various kinds of ads and content you can share. </p>



<h3>Page Content</h3>



<p>One of the first things you’ll have to do is set up a business page on Facebook. Here is where you can post images, write comments, and connect directly to your followers. Business pages will also lead traffic to your website, as well as provide contact information for your company. </p>



<h3>Product Listings</h3>



<p>One of the best ads you can do through Facebook is to promote a product (or product line). The ad showcases the item, the price, and has a link to the sales page on your website. You can also add discounts so that users are more willing to click. </p>



<h3>Video Content</h3>



<p>When compared to images and/or text, video is going to get noticed and shared much more often. All internet users are more likely to watch a clip than pay attention to a single graphic. These video ads can show up in your audience’s feed and lead back to your business page or website. </p>



<h2>Why Facebook Marketing Works</h2>



<p>Before spending money on a new ad campaign, you want to be sure that you’ll get a good investment. Fortunately, Facebook has become good at targeting users, which means that you can generate a lot more buzz around your brand and your products. </p>



<h4><strong>Here are the top reasons why Facebook marketing is such a valuable tool for your business. </strong></h4>



<h3>Expansive User Base</h3>



<p>Although recent headlines have made some users wary of logging onto the social site, the fact is that Facebook has the most members. Over 80 percent of all internet users have a Facebook profile, with 65 percent of people over 65 having an account as well. </p>



<p>Simply put, your target audience is probably using Facebook, which means that you should too. While Facebook marketing shouldn’t be the only type of advertising you do, it will be one of the most rewarding. </p>



<h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>



<p>What kind of products do you sell? If you were to come up with a buyer persona, what type of person would want to shop at your store? No matter what answer you give, Facebook has the tools to reach that demographic. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the various metrics that Facebook can use to find new users include:</strong></p>



<p>Age<br>
Location<br>
Hobbies<br>
Interests<br>
Marital Status<br>
Family Status</p>



<p>So, if you’re trying to reach single moms ages 30-45 in Los Angeles, Facebook can help you craft a campaign that will target them directly. You can focus in on your audience even further by seeing what products they’ve liked and purchased in the past, as well as general interests that could help you connect with them. </p>



<h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>



<p>In the old days of marketing, you would spend time and money on a new campaign, put it out, and then hope that it worked. Whether it was a coupon mailer, a TV or print advertisement, or a sign in front of your store, you didn’t know what would happen until people started coming in. Even then, you couldn’t be sure whether they were coming because of your ad or for another reason.</p>



<p>Fortunately, now it’s never been easier to analyze your marketing tactics to see what works and what doesn’t. No longer do you have to waste energy and money on a campaign that may not pan out. Instead, you can get detailed analytics that show how effective your ads are and what you can do to make them even better. </p>



<h3>Cost Savings</h3>



<p>When compared with other kinds of marketing tactics, Facebook is going to generate a higher ROI. On average, you could be spending less than $5 per conversion. If your average sales order is much higher than that (i.e., $15-$30), you are going to make a lot more than you’ll spend. </p>



<p>Best of all, the site uses a pay-per-click model, meaning that you don’t have to pay a flat rate upfront. The better your ads do, the more money Facebook makes, so you will get excellent results. </p>



<h3>Bottom Line: Facebook Marketing is Effective</h3>



<p>No matter which way you look at it, advertising on Facebook is a smart move for your business. If you haven’t set up a page yet, now is the perfect time to get started. Once you see the power of the social platform, you’ll wonder how you managed without it. </p>

<p>Many small business owners believe that they can effectively market their business. But, marketing your business takes time and resources. You may need to spend countless hours writing a blog or social media post that does not produce the results you are looking for. Not to mention the research that needs to go into the marketing. Your research needs to include your target market, branding, demographics and competitors.</p>
<p>A marketing agency can free up your time from marketing. This free time can allow you to focus on other aspects of your business. An agency can also provide your business with faster turnaround times for projects because it focuses solely on marketing your business. The marketing agency does not require training like an in-house employee. So, as a business owner you are saving time on training when you contract a marketing agency.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Marketing Agency Expertise Versus In-House Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Many small businesses believe they can handle the marketing, but they may not have the knowledge to create effective marketing plans. There are so many avenues that a small business can take for marketing and advertising. Understanding and knowing which roads can benefit your company the most is key to success.</p>
<p>A single person in a small business can write a blog or create a social media campaign. But would that individual have the knowledge of effective keywords for search engine optimization (SEO) or pay per click advertising. These things can help increase the traffic to your website. When you use a marketing agency, it has the resources and knowledge available to provide effective keywords for the SEO and setup a pay per click advertising campaign not to mention running effective social media blitzes.</p>
<p>Another significant difference between an agency and internal marketing individual is the access to the tools needed to create the different campaigns. When you look at a marketing agency, it has all the updated tools like software and hardware to complete any project. The purpose of the agency is to provide services to the clients by focusing only on the marketing aspect of the business. The agency can purchase these tools and then utilize each of the tools for all of its clients. The agency is also able to update their tools more often because the agency can distribute costs across all the clients. Where a small business would need to purchase any of the software or hardware for marketing purposes it can cost a pretty penny depending on the need. The small business may not have or struggle to get the capital money for new or upgraded equipment.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Monetary Benefits</strong></p>
<p>The monetary benefits of an agency are most likely the biggest factor to consider. The annual difference is substantial. When you think about a dedicated marketing person in a small business, you not only have the salary expense but everything else that comes with it. In addition to the salary, the company will need to pay taxes, social security, Medicare, medical, training, sick time and vacation time. The annual amount can easily exceed $100,000.00 per year for an employee. But a marketing agency requires a contract fee and an administrative charge. The contract fee is a monthly fee to cover the agency’s personnel on your account. The administrative fee is a monthly fee that helps cover the costs of the software, equipment and supplies. The administrative fee costs are lower than a small business purchasing the same equipment on their own.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Since the marketing agency’s main focus is marketing for other businesses, it can use the available capital money to reinvest in the tools of the trade. A small business on the other hand needs to look at investing in all aspects of the business. The small business cannot focus capital money on only one area. This benefit provides the agency with the advantage of having the newest tools and equipment over your small business.</p>
<p>As a small business, another aspect to consider is training. When you have a marketing employee it will take time for them to train, this means you have expenses too. The training expenses include the salary and benefits but also the costs for training seminars, software classes and travel (if necessary). You need to also consider the company may not see the benefits from a new marketing employee right away. It may take some time for the results become visible. If you use an agency you do not have training costs. The agency personnel are ready to tackle the marketing projects you throw at them.</p>
<p><strong>Different Perspective</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot decide on whether to hire an employee or contract an agency for your marketing needs, you may want to consider a different perspective. When you have an employee, they may try to stick with the perspective of the company. An employee may not think outside the box if he or she fears there may be consequences. Bringing in someone not affiliated with the company can provide a different way of looking at things. When you look at something from the outside, you may see things many overlook because it is always there. You can have a fresh set of</p>

<p>A marketing agency has the benefit of working with several different clients which can provide other ways of looking at things. For example, your company may want to try a marketing approach and the agency has a campaign similar to the approach you want you use. They can provide you with information like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the campaign successful?</li>
<li>What did not work?</li>
<li>Should you do things differently?</li>
<li>Is this campaign the best fit for your company?</li>
<li>Should you consider something in addition to this to reinforce the outcome?</li>
<li>When is the best time to initiate the campaign?</li>
</ul></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>When Google’s algorithms rank business websites, one of the most important properties that they look for in that website is how well it is rated. On average, businesses on the first page of Google search results pages have a rating of just under four and a half stars and 64 percent of businesses in the top three positions are rated between four and five stars. High star ratings are critical for getting a good rank in Google’s SERPS. Here are some reasons why getting a good score on Google reviews will help your business and what The F.A.M.O.S. Group can do to help you achieve it for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>It Signals to Google That You’re An Authority</strong></p>
<p>Google doesn’t want to put below average sites first on its result pages, but it doesn’t have the time to try out each business for itself to determine its quality. Therefore, it looks at a host of specific details as a way of measuring each local businesses strengths. Not least of these is Google reviews. While there are a number of different rating sites for customers to rank their experience, Google reviews are what Google looks at the most.</p>
<p>Here is some of the data: 64% of websites in the top three positions have a score between four and five stars. Meanwhile, for websites in spots seven through ten, only 59% had that same rating. Furthermore, only 20% of sites in the top three positions of Google&#8217;s search results pages had no reviews on Google compared those in spots seven through ten, where 26% of websites had no reviews. Therefore it’s clear that in order to achieve a high position on Google results pages, an excellent star rating is something your business will benefit from greatly.</p>
<p><strong>It Makes Your Business Appear More Trustworthy to Customers</strong></p>
<p>High star ratings are incredibly useful, not only for signaling to Google that your business is a force to be reckoned with but also for letting customers know that your business is one they can trust. Making it to the top of the results pages is only the first step. Once there, you’ll need to make yourself appealing to customers as well, and one of the first things customers see is a rating between one and five stars.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, sites with higher star ratings are more likely to get clicks than sites with low star ratings. While a click and a sale are two very different actions, think of clicks as the raw material that you need to make sales.</p>
<p>Remember, clients are very wary of wasting their time and money on businesses that won’t give them what they want, so they rely on the opinions of people who have gone before to help them make decisions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the final word on your company is out of your hands. This may seem daunting, but it’s actually good news for local businesses since there are simple strategies you can use to guarantee top ratings.</p>
<p><strong>It Benefits Your Business Long Term</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons why high star ratings on Google business reviews are good for your company is that it helps you achieve long-lasting success without continuous labor or ongoing stress. This is because, when your company scores high on Google&#8217;s ranking algorithms, it puts your website higher up on Google’s search results pages.</p>
<p>From there, more internet users are going to be directed to your business through their queries and click on your link. The more clicks you receive, the more Google is going to take notice of your website, increasing your SEO and leading again to more clicks.</p>
<p>This domino effect can be used to your advantage as you ride the ranking systems to the top of the search results pages. It’s a long known principle of SEO that clicks turn into more clicks, so make sure that you have a high star rating to stand out from your competitors.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_14  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_10 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Social media started out as a way to connect with friends, but it has evolved into so much more. Businesses can leverage social media branding to grow their brand and connect with both existing and potential customers &#8211; if they know what they’re doing. Social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, are ruled by algorithms. Those algorithms are always changing, so figuring out the right long-term strategy for your brand can be a challenge.</p>
<p>To further complicate matters, social media is full of other businesses all trying to connect with customers. Despite these challenges, there are brands that find a way to dominate on social media and actively engage with their followers. Check out these six tricks to elevate your social media efforts and get more leads.</p>
<p><strong>1. Share Content Several Times</strong></p>
<p>Make the most of your blog posts by promoting them on social media multiple times. Sharing posts several times increases visibility which in turn increases engagement and traffic to your site.</p>
<p>Keep things fresh and interesting by changing up the content each time you post. Get creative and swap out text and images to entice users to like, share and comment. Try to post at different times in order to reach users who may have missed the post the first, second or third time around.</p>
<p><strong>2. Build Anticipation</strong></p>
<p>The more interesting your post is, the more likely users will follow the link to learn more. Add statistics, intriguing quotes and more to generate excitement and anticipation. Whenever possible latch on to trends. Incorporating trending topics into your social media posts can help raise awareness and increase engagement of your posts, but this trick works best when it is relevant and appears natural.</p>
<p><strong>3. Promote Audiences Participation</strong></p>
<p>User-generated social media content can keep your feed flowing and help establish relationships with your followers. Encouraging your audience to post photos and videos can keep your feed full without a major time investment on your part. Make sure to remind users to tag your brand in the posts, so they show up in your feed and help to broaden your reach. Consider creating a custom hashtag, so the posts are searchable and easy to find.</p>
<p>Looping followers into the content creation process takes engagement to a new level. Users will form a bond with your brand and this can help transform users into brand ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use the Right Hashtags</strong></p>
<p>Compelling and engaging content is a must, but if this content doesn’t reach your audience your efforts are for nothing. Hashtags are basically search terms that can be used to find posts and help to ensure your content lands in front of the right people. Crafting relevant and interesting hashtags is an integral component of any social media branding strategy.</p>
<p>Finding the right hashtags is a careful balance. You want hashtags that are interesting, engaging and pull readers in, but when using established hashtags avoid anything too popular. Extremely popular hashtags may present a high level of competition and your posts may become lost.</p>
<p>More does not translate to better when it comes to hashtags. Too many hashtags may take away from the content of your post. Hashtags should also be tied in to the content and message of the post.</p>
<p><strong>5. Collaborate with Industry Leaders</strong></p>
<p>Large brands, media and industry influencers have sizable followings. Partner with these users to position your brand in front of a larger audience. Influencers often have loyal followings, so when this individual works with and vouches for your brand that endorsement can help grow your following.</p>
<p>Collaborating with influencers can prove to be very effective, but you need to find the right influencers. The right partner for your brand will share the same target audience. Working with the right partner can increase the awareness of your brand.</p>
<p><strong>6. Do Some Good</strong></p>
<p>Consumers like to support brands that support social causes. Supporting a cause that aligns with your brand’s values can help make a positive impact and show personality while also endearing your brand to followers. Studies show millennials are even willing to spend more in order to support brands that in turn support causes they believe in.</p>
<p><strong>7. Up Your Customer Service Game</strong></p>
<p>Customer service is possibly one of the best methods to retain customers. Answering questions and resolving issues can help customers gain a better understanding and appreciation of your products or services. Extend your customer service to social media. Encourage users to ask questions and be prepared to handle anything that comes up.</p>
<p>Put customers to work for your brand by soliciting feedback. Ask customers to leave reviews and ratings on your social media accounts. This firsthand information helps establish trust and sway purchasing decisions for other customers. User feedback can also provide invaluable information to help you make process and service improvements and ultimately help customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Social media branding can attract new followers and further establish your relationship with existing customers and increase your online presence while also moving users through your sales funnel. These are some stellar benefits, but the thing is you have a lot of competition all fighting to gain the attention of the same users. Including these tips into your social media branding strategy can help your brand stand apart.</p>
