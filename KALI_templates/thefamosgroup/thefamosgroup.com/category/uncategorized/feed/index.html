<p>Social media marketing has exploded in the past five years, and it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Of the available channels for social media outreach, Facebook remains the 800-lb. silverback gorilla of them all. Business2Community estimates 70 percent of marketers currently use Facebook as one of their chief methods to adding new customers and generating leads. Moreover, 47 percent of marketers stated  Facebook is the number one source of new business. Clearly, marketing on Facebook gets results. How does it work? Let’s get an overview of how businesses are reaching more new customers on Facebook.</p>



<h3>Facebook Marketing: What It Is And How It Works</h3>



<p>Using Facebook to market your business means posting authentic, original content via a business account or individual account. This content is purpose-built for viral sharing among regular Facebook users, and it always points them back to your website, landing page or Facebook profile. </p>



<p>When you market on Facebook, you are putting your business out there as a thought leader and content creator who is looking to help other Facebook users meet their needs and desires through your products and/or services. There are two principal methods to go about this process, and you can decide for yourself how much or how little actual marketing dollars you want to invest. </p>



<h3>Organic Facebook Advertising</h3>



<p>Considered the most effective and powerful form of Facebook marketing, this method focuses on fostering the “organic reach” of your content. Organic reach refers to how many users have viewed your posts and content through unpaid distribution. In other words, people who have seen what you put out on Facebook without you paying to sponsor its placement in newsfeeds. </p>



<p>Since it’s unpaid, it is going to have a lower cost-per-add of new customers who discover your business via sharing. The downside is the organic method requires far more work intensive for your marketing team, and you will need to tailor content to the demographics of users who have expressed interest and your product/services target demographic. Additionally, unless your content compels users to click, read more and engage with landing pages or other lead collection methods, you aren’t going to see the same results as you would from paid content promotion via Facebook Ads dashboard. </p>



<h3>Paid Facebook Advertising</h3>



<p>The sheer volume of content created for organic marketing on Facebook is staggering, and it has actually started to decrease its own effectiveness to a degree. If you are looking to build some momentum to help your content get found by the right people, you may need to consider setting up paid advertising for some posts. Facebook implements by adding a Boost button to posts on your newsfeed, and if you want to boost a post to reach your target audience you just need to complete a few simple forms.</p>



<p>First, you pick the audience type that coincides with your ideal customer demographic. Next, you pick a budget of how much you want to spend. You can prepay a certain amount and then the post no longer gets promoted after your budget has been exhausted. This is a great way to keep your advertising spending under control so you don’t end up with a hefty surprise item that pushes your marketing team over budget. Finally, you select how long you want to boost your content post. Choosing how long to promote content is another cost control measure, and it also helps Facebook provide an estimate for recommending a budget. </p>



<p>Paid Facebook advertising has the drawback of an additional cost to promote your presence on Facebook, but it is also a guaranteed method for ensuring your content regarding products/services is seen and read by your target audience. New customer ads from paid advertising might not be as profitable as organic marketing, but it keeps revenue coming all the same.</p>



<h3>A Winning Combination: Using Organic And Paid Marketing Together To Drive Sales</h3>



<p>Smart marketers and marketing agencies use the ad performance data from their organic marketing outreach to better target their paid outreach. When you evaluate who looks at your content the most when it is not sponsored, it tells you who is looking for your specific products/services, when they look, their demographic information and other information to help you pinpoint everything in your content and promote it to the best audience. Most marketing agencies are willing to spend the money to promote their content at first and then let organic content take over or balance out how much or how little they spend on the actual sponsored content.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social media has become an integral part of our lives, and no platform is more ubiquitous than Facebook. Every year, it seems that the company expands its outreach to encompass more people and offer more services, which makes it an ideal marketing tool for businesses. </p>



<p>Today, we want to discuss the value of Facebook marketing and how it can help you achieve your goals. Regardless of the kind of company you have, marketing on Facebook is going to boost your brand awareness and ensure long-term success. Let’s discover how you can make that a reality. </p>



<h2>Organic vs. Paid Advertising</h2>



<p>One of the reasons why social media has taken off in recent years is that it put small businesses on the same footing as large corporations. Setting up a page was free, and with the right amount of effort and creativity, you could generate a large following. </p>



<p>While that’s still possible today, it’s much more challenging. The fact is that companies like Facebook are pushing hard to monetize their marketing services. With so much user information available, you can reach target demographics with pinpoint precision. </p>



<p>Thus, paid advertising is going to help you get a lot more traction. Building an organic audience of followers is still advisable, but it will take much longer to get the same results. Being active on social media is a must regardless of which route you choose but paying Facebook for a broader reach is going to provide a significantly better ROI. </p>



<h2>Types of Facebook Marketing</h2>



<p>Before we get into the benefits of using this platform, let’s go over the various kinds of ads and content you can share. </p>



<h3>Page Content</h3>



<p>One of the first things you’ll have to do is set up a business page on Facebook. Here is where you can post images, write comments, and connect directly to your followers. Business pages will also lead traffic to your website, as well as provide contact information for your company. </p>



<h3>Product Listings</h3>



<p>One of the best ads you can do through Facebook is to promote a product (or product line). The ad showcases the item, the price, and has a link to the sales page on your website. You can also add discounts so that users are more willing to click. </p>



<h3>Video Content</h3>



<p>When compared to images and/or text, video is going to get noticed and shared much more often. All internet users are more likely to watch a clip than pay attention to a single graphic. These video ads can show up in your audience’s feed and lead back to your business page or website. </p>



<h2>Why Facebook Marketing Works</h2>



<p>Before spending money on a new ad campaign, you want to be sure that you’ll get a good investment. Fortunately, Facebook has become good at targeting users, which means that you can generate a lot more buzz around your brand and your products. </p>



<h4><strong>Here are the top reasons why Facebook marketing is such a valuable tool for your business. </strong></h4>



<h3>Expansive User Base</h3>



<p>Although recent headlines have made some users wary of logging onto the social site, the fact is that Facebook has the most members. Over 80 percent of all internet users have a Facebook profile, with 65 percent of people over 65 having an account as well. </p>



<p>Simply put, your target audience is probably using Facebook, which means that you should too. While Facebook marketing shouldn’t be the only type of advertising you do, it will be one of the most rewarding. </p>



<h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>



<p>What kind of products do you sell? If you were to come up with a buyer persona, what type of person would want to shop at your store? No matter what answer you give, Facebook has the tools to reach that demographic. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the various metrics that Facebook can use to find new users include:</strong></p>



<p>Age<br>
Location<br>
Hobbies<br>
Interests<br>
Marital Status<br>
Family Status</p>



<p>So, if you’re trying to reach single moms ages 30-45 in Los Angeles, Facebook can help you craft a campaign that will target them directly. You can focus in on your audience even further by seeing what products they’ve liked and purchased in the past, as well as general interests that could help you connect with them. </p>



<h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>



<p>In the old days of marketing, you would spend time and money on a new campaign, put it out, and then hope that it worked. Whether it was a coupon mailer, a TV or print advertisement, or a sign in front of your store, you didn’t know what would happen until people started coming in. Even then, you couldn’t be sure whether they were coming because of your ad or for another reason.</p>



<p>Fortunately, now it’s never been easier to analyze your marketing tactics to see what works and what doesn’t. No longer do you have to waste energy and money on a campaign that may not pan out. Instead, you can get detailed analytics that show how effective your ads are and what you can do to make them even better. </p>



<h3>Cost Savings</h3>



<p>When compared with other kinds of marketing tactics, Facebook is going to generate a higher ROI. On average, you could be spending less than $5 per conversion. If your average sales order is much higher than that (i.e., $15-$30), you are going to make a lot more than you’ll spend. </p>



<p>Best of all, the site uses a pay-per-click model, meaning that you don’t have to pay a flat rate upfront. The better your ads do, the more money Facebook makes, so you will get excellent results. </p>



<h3>Bottom Line: Facebook Marketing is Effective</h3>



<p>No matter which way you look at it, advertising on Facebook is a smart move for your business. If you haven’t set up a page yet, now is the perfect time to get started. Once you see the power of the social platform, you’ll wonder how you managed without it. </p>
